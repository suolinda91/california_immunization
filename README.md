# california_immunization

I use a data set from Kaggle to visualise the immunization rates of incoming kindergarten students in California, USA. I make use of the library seaborn to visualise exemptions based on Personal Beliefs or medical issues and the immunization rates of MMR, Polio and DTP. In addition, I created a wordcloud to see whether there are certain school names that tend to have low immunization rates.
